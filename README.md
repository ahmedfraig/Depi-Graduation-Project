<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project focuses on <strong>Stress Detection and Analysis</strong> using EEG (Electroencephalogram) and ECG (Electrocardiogram) data. The goal is to preprocess this data and use it for developing machine learning models that can classify stress levels in individuals. We are leveraging Azure services for storage, computation, and model development.</p>

<h3>Current Stage:</h3>
<p>We have completed the data collection, storage setup, and preprocessing. The next steps involve model development and deployment.</p>

<h2 id="key-components">Key Components</h2>

<h3 id="1-azure-blob-storage">1. Azure Blob Storage</h3>

<h4>Storage Setup:</h4>
<p>Two containers have been created:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>raw-data</strong>: Contains the original EEG and ECG files.</li>
    <li><strong>processed-data</strong>: Contains the processed data, which has been cleaned and organized for analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can check out the code for managing Azure Blob Storage here: <a href="https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAboegela/Depi-Graduation-Project/tree/main/Docker_Apps/azure_blob_manager">Azure Blob Manager</a></p>

<h4>Security:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>OAuth 2.0 authentication is used to ensure secure access.</li>
    <li>Credentials are managed via environment variables.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-data-mounting-in-databricks">2. Data Mounting in Databricks</h3>

<h4>Mounting Process:</h4>
<p>The <strong>raw data</strong> and <strong>processed data</strong> containers were mounted to Databricks for direct access to the data without needing manual downloads.</p>
<p>You can find the data mounting scripts here: <a href="https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAboegela/Depi-Graduation-Project/tree/main/DataBricks_PreProcessing">Databricks PreProcessing</a></p>

<h4>Mount Points:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><code>/mnt/stressdata</code>: For raw data.</li>
    <li><code>/mnt/processedstressdata</code>: For processed data.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Security:</h4>
<p>The Azure credentials (client ID, tenant ID, and client secret) were securely used for mounting the Blob Storage.</p>

<h3 id="3-data-preprocessing">3. Data Preprocessing</h3>

<h4>Data Types:</h4>
<p>The project deals with two primary types of data:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ECG Data</strong>: Heart rate variability and other metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>EEG Data</strong>: Brainwave frequencies (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find the preprocessing scripts here: <a href="https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAboegela/Depi-Graduation-Project/tree/main/DataBricks_PreProcessing">Preprocessing Code</a></p>

<h4>Processing:</h4>
<p>Both datasets were cleaned, merged, and exported back to the processed-data container. Important metrics, such as the ratio of Alpha and Beta power in EEG, were calculated.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-run-the-blob-storage-app">How to Run the Blob Storage App</h2>

<p>We developed a Python application for easy access to the Azure Blob Storage containers, allowing for the upload, download, and deletion of files.</p>
<p>You can find the application here: <a href="https://github.com/AbdelrahmanAboegela/Depi-Graduation-Project/tree/main/Docker_Apps/azure_blob_manager">Azure Blob Manager App</a></p>

<h4>Steps:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository containing the app.</li>
    <li>Ensure Docker is installed on your machine.</li>
    <li>To run the app, use the following command:
    <pre><code>docker run -p 5000:5000 -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 apdoelepe/azure_blob_manager</code></pre></li>
    <li>If the app requires Azure credentials for access, contact me via GitHub or LinkedIn to provide the <code>azure_credentials.txt</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>OAuth 2.0 Authentication</strong> ensures that only authorized users can access the Azure Blob Storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Environment Variables</strong> are used for handling sensitive information like client secrets, ensuring that they are not exposed in the codebase.</li>
    <li><strong>Docker Deployment</strong>: The app is containerized using Docker for easy deployment across different environments, ensuring that the same version is available to the entire team.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sql-queries">SQL Queries</h2>

<p>This section of the project contains the SQL queries and stored procedures that are used to create tables, insert data, and execute queries in the database. The following SQL files are included in this folder:</p>

<h3>1. Create Tables</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>ECG Tables</strong>: SQL queries to create tables for storing ECG data.</li>
    <li><strong>EEG Tables</strong>: SQL queries to create tables for storing EEG data.</li>
    <li><strong>EEG Ratio Tables</strong>: SQL queries to create tables for storing the ratio of EEG Alpha to Beta power.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Create Schemas</h3>
<p>SQL queries for creating schemas in the database, ensuring proper data organization.</p>

<h3>3. Stored Procedure Execution</h3>

<h2 id="model-development">Model Development</h2>
<p>The project uses an LSTM-based deep learning model for stress detection. The model processes sequential EEG and ECG data, learning temporal dependencies to classify stress levels in individuals. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are ideal for handling such time-series data, as they retain information over long time periods.</p>
<p>The key components of the model:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two Bidirectional LSTM layers for forward and backward sequence learning.</li>
    <li>Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.</li>
    <li>Dense layers to perform the final classification.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key components of the model:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two Bidirectional LSTM layers for forward and backward sequence learning.</li>
    <li>Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.</li>
    <li>Dense layers to perform the final classification.</li>
</ul>

<p>The model was trained with 150 epochs and a batch size of 16, with the Adam optimizer. The binary cross-entropy loss function was used, as the task involves binary classification (stressed vs. not stressed). The ReduceLROnPlateau and EarlyStopping callbacks were implemented to improve the training process and prevent overfitting.</p>

<h2 id="visualization">Visualization</h2>
<p>The visualization part of the project focuses on presenting the relationship between stress levels and physiological data (EEG and ECG). We used tools like <strong>Matplotlib</strong> to create insightful visualizations of the stress classification results, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>EEG Frequency Analysis:</strong> Visualizes the power of different brainwave bands (Delta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma) during stress events.</li>
    <li><strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV):</strong> Shows how HRV metrics correlate with stress levels over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Gender-Based Stress Differences:</strong> Compares stress responses across male and female participants.</li>
</ul>

<p>These visualizations provide crucial insights into how EEG and ECG metrics vary under different stress conditions, and help in identifying significant features for model training. The visualizations also aid in understanding how well the model is performing across different stress phases (e.g., baseline, low stress, high stress).</p>

<h2 id="pipeline-deploy">Pipeline & Deploy</h2>
<p>For deploying the project, we have created a containerized environment using <strong>Docker</strong> for easy replication and deployment across different systems. The pipeline is designed to automate data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and visualization generation.</p>

<h4>Key Components of the Pipeline:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Ingestion:</strong> The raw EEG and ECG data are uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. The Python-based Azure Blob Manager app is used to manage the storage of raw and processed data.</li>
    <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The data is preprocessed in Databricks, where it is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for analysis. Key metrics like EEG power ratios are computed during this stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> The LSTM-based deep learning model is trained on the preprocessed data. The model can be retrained easily using the preconfigured scripts in Databricks or locally using Docker.</li>
    <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> The trained model is deployed in a Docker container. Streamlit is used to create an interactive user interface, allowing real-time stress prediction based on new EEG/ECG data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps to run the pipeline:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Ensure Docker is installed on your system.</li>
    <li>Clone the repository containing the Docker setup.</li>
    <li>Run the following command to start the Docker container:
    <pre><code>docker run -p 8501:8501 -e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0 apdoelepe/stress_model_deploy</code></pre></li>
    <li>Access the application through the browser, where you can upload new EEG/ECG data for real-time stress detection.</li>
</ol>
